The **Chat with Multiple PDFs** project leverages the advanced capabilities of the GOOGLE GEMINI AI model to provide rapid and accurate responses to queries based on the content of uploaded PDF documents. This innovative solution enables users to obtain detailed information from multiple PDFs within seconds, streamlining the process of information retrieval and enhancing productivity.

To utilize this code for personal or professional use, users must first generate an API key for the AI model from Google. This key should be saved in an '.env' file as the value for the variable 'GOOGLE_API_KEY'. After this setup, users can install the necessary libraries by running the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' file. Once the dependencies are installed, the application can be executed by running 'streamlit run app.py'.
